Repository of synthetic floor accelerograms
Author: Derek Rodriguez Pacheco, PhD

There are 5 sets of synthetic floor motions. 'N#' contains the 
X component of the synthetic motions, while 'N#_b' contains the
Y component of the synthetic motions.

Inside each folder there are nine folders each corresponding to
seismic hazard return period (30, 50, 70, 100, 140, 475, 975 and
2475-year return period, respectively).

The file 'Durations.txt' contains the durations of each of the 10
simulated synthetic floor motions. The file 'SFM_Nt#.txt' contains
the acceleration time-history in units of (g) of the simulated
synthetic floor accelerogram with a time step equal to 0.01 s. The 
file 'FRS2_N#.txt' contains the 2% damped floor response spectrum of 
the corresponding synthetic motion with a period step equal to 0.01s.
The file 'SFRS_Nt#.txt' contains the 5% damped floor response spectrum
of the corresponding synthetic floor motion with an angular frequency step
equal to 0.023 rad/s. The file 'SM_Duration.txt' contains the strong motion
durations of the simulated synhtetic motions. The files 'T5.txt' and 
'T95.txt' contains the time instant in which the simulated synthetic 
motions reach the 5% and the 95%, respectively, of the total Arias intensity.
